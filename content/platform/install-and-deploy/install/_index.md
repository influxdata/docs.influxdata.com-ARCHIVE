There are multiple ways to install and configure the InfluxData Platform (also known
as the TICK stack). Included below are several installation options and relevant
links for exploring the InfluxData Platform and its TICK stack components.

## [Deploy the InfluxData Platform (TICK stack) in Docker containers](/platform/install-and-deploy/deploy/sandbox-install)

The quickest way to install the InfluxData Platform is to [deploy the InfluxData Platform OSS (TICK stack) in Docker containers using the InfluxData Sandbox](/platform/install-and-deploy/deploy/sandbox-install) to quickly get up and running and ready for exploration
and testing. The InfluxData Sandbox is not intended for production environments,
but it is a quick way to start using the InfluxData Platform and work with Docker
containers.
