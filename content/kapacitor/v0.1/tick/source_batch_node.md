A node that handles creating several child BatchNodes. 
Each call to `query` creates a child batch node that 
can further be configured. See [BatchNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/batch_node.html) 
The `batch` variable in batch tasks is an instance of 
a [SourceBatchNode.](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/source_batch_node.html) 

Example: 


```javascript
     var errors = batch
                      .query('SELECT value from errors')
                      ...
     var views = batch
                      .query('SELECT value from views')
                      ...
```



Chaining Methods
----------------

Chaining methods create a new node in the pipeline as a child of the calling node. They do not modify the calling node.

### Query

The query to execute. Must not contain a time condition 
in the `WHERE` clause or contain a `GROUP BY` clause. 
The time conditions are added dynamically according to the period, offset and schedule. 
The `GROUP BY` clause is added dynamically according to the dimensions 
passed to the `groupBy` method. 


```javascript
node.query(q string)
```

Returns: [BatchNode](/docs/kapacitor/v0.1/tick/batch_node.html)
