A node that handles creating several child BatchNodes.
Each call to `query` creates a child batch node that
can further be configured. See [BatchNode](/kapacitor/v0.2/tick/batch_node/)
The `batch` variable in batch tasks is an instance of
a [SourceBatchNode.](/kapacitor/v0.2/tick/source_batch_node/)

Example:


```javascript
     var errors = batch
                      .query('SELECT value from errors')
                      ...
     var views = batch
                      .query('SELECT value from views')
                      ...
```



Chaining Methods
----------------

Chaining methods create a new node in the pipeline as a child of the calling node. They do not modify the calling node.

### Query

The query to execute. Must not contain a time condition
in the `WHERE` clause or contain a `GROUP BY` clause.
The time conditions are added dynamically according to the period, offset and schedule.
The `GROUP BY` clause is added dynamically according to the dimensions
passed to the `groupBy` method.


```javascript
node.query(q string)
```

Returns: [BatchNode](/kapacitor/v0.2/tick/batch_node/)
