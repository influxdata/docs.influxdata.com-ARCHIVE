## Upgrading to 1.4 from 1.3

Version 1.4.x.x is a drop-in upgrade for the 1.3.x.x releases.
[Download and install](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads) the most recent version and restart the process.

> ***Note:*** In Chronograf 1.3.1+, installing a new version of Chronograf automatically clears the localStorage settings.

## Upgrade from older versions
### Versions: 0.4, 0.10 through 0.13, and 1.0

The closed source Chronograf product is deprecated and is no longer supported or developed.
There is no path for upgrading to the open source product.
Users can continue to use the deprecated product; documentation is available under the `Deprecated` header in the sidebar.
For more information, please read the original [announcement blog](https://www.influxdata.com/announcing-the-new-chronograf-a-ui-for-the-tick-stack-and-a-complete-open-source-monitoring-solution/) by our CTO, Paul Dix.

InfluxData recommends migrating to the open source Chronograf product.
