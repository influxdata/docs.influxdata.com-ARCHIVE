The closed source Chronograf product is deprecated and is no longer supported or developed.
There is no path for upgrading to the all-new open source product.
Users can continue to use the deprecated product; the documentation is available under the `Deprecated` header in the sidebar.
For more information, please read the original [announcement blog](https://www.influxdata.com/announcing-the-new-chronograf-a-ui-for-the-tick-stack-and-a-complete-open-source-monitoring-solution/) by our CTO, Paul Dix.

We highly recommend moving to the open source Chronograf product.
It's pretty great, we promise!
Check out the [Getting Started](/chronograf/v1.3/introduction/getting-started/) guide to get up and running!
