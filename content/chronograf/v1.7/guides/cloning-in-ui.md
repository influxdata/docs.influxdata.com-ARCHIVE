This guide explains how to clone, or duplicate, a dashboard or a cell for use as starting points for creating dashboards or cells using the copy as a template.

## Cloning dashboards

Dashboards in Chronograf can be cloned (or copied) to be used to create a dashboard based on the original. Rather than building a new dashboard from scratch, you can clone a dashboard and make changes to the dashboard copy.


### To clone a dashboard

1. On the **Dashboards** page, hover your cursor over the listing of the dashboard that you want to clone and click the **Clone** button that appears.

The cloned dashboard opens and displays the name of the original dashboard with `(clone)` after it.

You can now change the dashboard name and customize the dashboard.

## Cloning cells

Cells in Chronograf dashboards can be cloned, or copied, to quickly create a cell copy that can be edited for another use.

### To clone a cell

1. On the dashboard cell that you want to make a copy of, click the **Clone** icon and then confirm by clicking **Clone Cell**.
