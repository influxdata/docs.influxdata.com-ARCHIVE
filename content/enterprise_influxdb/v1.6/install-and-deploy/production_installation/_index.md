The Production Installation process is designed for users looking to deploy
InfluxDB Enterprise in a production environment.

If you wish to evaluate InfluxDB Enterprise in a non-production
environment, feel free to follow the instructions outlined in the
[QuickStart installation](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.6/install-and-deploy/quickstart_installation) section.
Please note that if you install InfluxDB Enterprise with the QuickStart Installation process you
will need to reinstall InfluxDB Enterprise with the Production Installation
process before using the product in a production environment.
