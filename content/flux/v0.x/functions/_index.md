Flux's functional syntax allows you to retrieve, transform, process, and output data easily.
There is a large library of built-in functions, but you can also create your own
custom functions to perform operations that suit your needs.

## [Input functions](/flux/v0.x/functions/inputs)
Input functions define or display information about data sources.

## [Output functions](/flux/v0.x/functions/outputs)
Output functions yield results or send data to a specified output.

## [Transformation functions](/flux/v0.x/functions/transformations)
Transformation functions transform or shape your data in specific ways.

## [Miscellaneous functions](/flux/v0.x/functions/misc)
Functions that serve miscellaneous purposes when writing Flux scripts.

## [Custom functions](/flux/v0.x/functions/custom-functions)
Flux's functional syntax allows for custom functions.
This guide walks through the basics of creating your own function.
