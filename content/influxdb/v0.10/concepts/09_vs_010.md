This page aims to ease the transition to InfluxDB 0.10 for those more familiar with 0.9.
It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of the differences between the versions.
See [InfluxDB's Changelog](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes.

There are not many breaking changes between InfluxDB version 0.9 and InfluxDB version 0.10:

* Continuous Query execution is now controlled by the `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY` statement.
* `tsm` is the only storage engine available in InfluxDB 0.10, although the system can still read `b1` and `bz1` shards.
* With `tsm` it is no longer possible to overwrite the field set for a point.
* Clustering implementation has incompatible improvements.

## Continuous Query Execution

In InfluxDB 0.9 the `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY` statement defines the Continuous Query's (CQ) database and the query to be performed.
Settings in the `[continuous_queries]` section of the configuration file control the frequency at which the CQ runs and how much historical data the CQ covers.
All CQs share the same configuration settings; this makes it difficult to optimize CQ execution for both short and long sampling intervals.

In InfluxDB 0.10 the `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY` statement also controls CQ execution.
By default, CQs run at the same interval as the CQ's `GROUP BY time()` interval, and the system calculates the query for the most recent `GROUP BY time()` interval.
A new and optional `RESAMPLE` clause allows users to specify how often the CQ runs and the time range over which InfluxDB runs the CQ.
The 0.9 CQ configuration settings are no longer in the configuration file and have been replaced by a single setting which controls how often InfluxDB checks to see if a CQ needs to run.

New documentation:

* [Reference documentation for the new CQ syntax](/influxdb/v0.10/query_language/spec/#create-continuous-query)
* [Gentle introduction to the new CQ syntax](/influxdb/v0.10/query_language/continuous_queries/#the-create-continuous-query-statement)
* [New CQ configuration setting](/influxdb/v0.10/administration/config/#continuous-queries)

> **Note:** CQs defined in InfluxDB 0.9 will still run in InfluxDB 0.10, but at a reduced frequency and with no resampling of data.
We strongly recommend that you update your CQs to the new 0.10 syntax to avoid incomplete downsampling.

## Data Storage Engine

InfluxDB 0.9 defaulted to using [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) for the underlying storage files.
The storage engine was referred to as the `b1` engine, or `bz1` for versions 0.9.3+ that supported compression of the BoltDB files.
As the database matured and performance improved, it became clear that BoltDB would not scale to the target performance.
Starting with InfluxDB 0.9.4 we added as an available storage engine the [Time Structured Merge tree](https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/concepts/storage_engine.html#the-new-influxdb-storage-engine-from-lsm-tree-to-b-tree-and-back-again-to-create-the-time-structured-merge-tree) (`tsm`).
`tsm` was never the default engine for any 0.9.x version of InfluxDB.

With InfluxDB 0.10, `tsm` is the only option for new shards. While InfluxDB 0.10.0 can still read the older `b1` and `bz1` shards from InfluxDB 0.9, it will only create new `tsm` shards.
InfluxData recommends [converting](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/cmd/influx_tsm/README.md) all legacy shards to `tsm` shards as soon as feasible. `tsm` is more performant and stable, and it will result in a significant reduction in disk usage.

## With `tsm` it is no longer possible to overwrite the field set for a point.

In InfluxDB 0.9, the system silently overwrites the field set of an old point if you write a new point with the same measurement, tag set, and timestamp.
In InfluxDB 0.10, the system no longer overwrites the field set; the field set becomes the union of the old field set and the new field set, where any ties go to the new field set.
See [Frequently Encountered Issues](/influxdb/v0.10/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#writing-duplicate-points) for an example.

## Clustering

InfluxDB 0.9 allowed data-only nodes. InfluxDB 0.10 allows data-only nodes as well as meta-only nodes.
This feature allows users to separate out meta nodes in very large clusters or configurations where data nodes are under heavy load. Another option is to have two nodes that act as meta and data nodes and one less-powered node that acts as a meta-only node.
This last option is similar to some other databases that allow you to run with two large servers and an “arbiter”.

The new configuration has changed slightly how clusters get set up with this version.
